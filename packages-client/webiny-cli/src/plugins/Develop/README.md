# Develop plugin
This plugin is used in development to run webpack builds and watch for file changes.
The following packages take part in the process:
- `browser-sync` - used to serve static files and forward requests to middlewares
- `webpack-dev-middleware`
- `webpack-hot-middleware`
 
During development build files are stored in `/public_html/build/development` folder. 
Each app has its own corresponding folder with the built assets and `stats.html` file generated by `webpack-visualizer-plugin`.

## `browser-sync`
You can modify browser-sync configuration via the `browser-sync-config` hook (see below).
To see the list of available options, visit [browser-sync](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options) documentation page.

## `webpack-dev-middleware`
You can configure dev-middleware options using the following key in your project's `webiny.json` file: `cli.plugins.develop.devMiddleware`.
To see the list of available options, visit [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) github page.
If this is not enough, use the `dev-middleware-options` hook (see below) to modify the options via JS.
