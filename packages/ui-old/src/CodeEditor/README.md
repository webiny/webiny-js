### Description

`CodeEditor` is a wrapper around one of the most popular code editors called `Ace` editor. Have in mind that you still
have to import `brace` as a dependency (after importing `CodeEditor`) for different code formats and editor types.

###Â Import

```js
import brace from "brace";
import { CodeEditor } from "@webiny/ui/CodeEditor";

// Make sure to import this after CodeEditor. Check official docs for available modes and themes.
import "brace/mode/json";
import "brace/theme/github";
```
