### Description

`Tabs` component is used to group content for better readability.

By default it will mount tab content only when the tab is actually selected.
Alternatively, it can also keep tab content always mounted - even when it's not active. This might be useful eg.
when validating forms which span across two or more tabs.

###Â Import

```js
import { Tabs, Tab, TabIcon } from "@webiny/ui/Tabs";
```
