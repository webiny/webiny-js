#  Webiny Main API
#
#  This is the core API that has access to all the features of your Webiny instance.
#
#  Note: to use the API outside of the playground, you will need to provide an API key via the Authorization header.
#
#  Example query - list all users:
{
  security {
    listUsers {
      data {
        login
        firstName
        createdOn
      }
    }
  }
}
