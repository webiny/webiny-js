/**
 * This folder contains all of the entities that you might need in your application.
 * You are free to define additional entities, if needed.
 *
 * Note that, by default, entities are defined via a library called DynamoDB Toolbox.
 * If you prefer a different library (e.g. AWS SDK's Document Client), you can use that as well.
 *
 * To learn more about the DynamoDB Toolbox, check the official GitHub page:
