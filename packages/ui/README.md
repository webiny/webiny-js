A collection of [material-design](https://material.io/) based 
components, for all of your UI development needs. 

A large amount of components are basically thin wrappers around the
already well-known [RMWC](https://rmwc.io/) library. With that, 
there are a few additional components that weren't included in it.

Please visit the official [storybook](https://storybook.webiny.com/) page 
for details and examples of each component.
  
## Install

npm install --save @webiny/ui
