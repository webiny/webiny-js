# Input

An Input component is commonly used inside a `<Form>` component which provides value, onChange callback, validation, etc.
You can use it outside of a `<Form>` component, but then you have to handle value changes and validation (if any) on your own.

## Import
```js
import Input from "webiny-client-ui-material/Input";
```
