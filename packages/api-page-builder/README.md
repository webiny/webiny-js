## For developers

### Page Builder Installation Files
This package must be deployed via the `@webiny/serverless-page-builder` component, because the Page Builder installation process relies on the installation ZIP file that will be upladed by the component. This ZIP file is located at `components/serverless-page-builder/installation/page_builder_installation_files.zip`.

#### page_builder_installation_files.zip

This file contains initial database data and phyiscal files - images, used on initial pages and page elements. Once unzipped, you will get the following folder structure:

```
├── data
└── images
    ├── elements
    │   └── images
    └── pages
        └── images
```

In the `data` folder, you will find JSON files, which represent initial data that will be inserted into the database in the Page Builder installation process (pages, page elements, categories and menus).

The `images` folder contains all of the images.
