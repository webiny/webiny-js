# @webiny/project-utils
A collection of utilities for Webiny project.

If you've ever created a project using `create-react-app` you know its config is hidden from you unless you [eject](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject), which isn't really a good option because you won't receive any new updates they ship for `react-scripts`. Besides, `react-sripts` does not support monorepos. So the good people at [rescripts](https://github.com/harrysolovay/rescripts) created this tool to override `react-scripts` without ejecting 🎉 .

In each of your React apps setup by Webiny CLI, you will find a `.rescriptsrc.js` file which loads a Webiny rescript from `@webiny/project-utils/cra` (you can add more rescripts here if you like).

When running a build of your React app, we run `rescripts` (see `package.json` scripts), which intercepts the webpack config generated by `react-scripts` and allow you to modify it. In our rescript we enable `babelrc` files and also add all your monorepo packages to webpack's `resolve.alias` to make them accessible from your React app.

A quick overview of tools included in this package:

- `aliases` - creates `jest` and `webpack` aliases.
- `cra` - this is our [rescript](https://github.com/harrysolovay/rescripts#rescript-structure) to get a CRA app to work as we want it to. Again, tweak it to your heart's content :)
- `packages` - simply loads monorepo packages using `get-yarn-workspaces` package.
